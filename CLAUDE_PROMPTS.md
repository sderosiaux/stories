## 2025-08-05 - Redesign Persona Showcase Layout

**Title:** Reorganize personas section for better discoverability

**Prompt Analysis:** The user's request was clear and actionable: "it's still unclear that we have to click on Bob to see the panel updated, can you put Alice first, and below Bob, would be better to see each skill & tools/daily frustation without clicking to discover". This was a good UX feedback that identified a discoverability problem with the interactive design.

**Result:** 
- Completely redesigned PersonaShowcase component to show Alice first (at top), then Bob below
- Removed click-to-reveal interaction and made all information visible by default
- Restructured layout to show Skills, Daily Tools, and Daily Frustrations in clear columns
- Added proper icons for each section (Settings for Skills, Terminal/Database for Tools, Coffee for Frustrations)
- Maintained visual hierarchy with large personas cards but made content immediately discoverable

**Files touched:**
- Modified: `/private/tmp/storyselfserve/conduktor-story/src/components/PersonaShowcase.tsx`

## 2025-08-05 - Fix ACL Cleanup Messaging and Hero Transition

**Title:** Correct ACL cleanup security focus and fix slow transitions

**Prompt Analysis:** User provided two specific pieces of feedback: 1) ACL cleanup should focus on security risks rather than storage (since ACLs are just metadata), and 2) the before/after transition at the top was slow and weird. Both were valid technical corrections.

**Result:**
- Updated FederatedAccess component to emphasize security risks of stale ACLs rather than storage reclamation
- Changed messaging from "Storage reclaimed: 73%" to "Security improved: Zero stale access"
- Updated description to focus on bad actors and ex-employees exploiting stale credentials
- Fixed HeroSection before/after transition by replacing slow 3D rotateY animation with faster scale/opacity transition (0.3s instead of 0.6s)
- Fixed Bob's Journey timeline status badge rendering issue by simplifying Framer Motion animations

**Files touched:**
- Modified: `/private/tmp/storyselfserve/conduktor-story/src/components/FederatedAccess.tsx`
- Modified: `/private/tmp/storyselfserve/conduktor-story/src/components/HeroSection.tsx`
- Modified: `/private/tmp/storyselfserve/conduktor-story/src/components/BobJourney.tsx`
